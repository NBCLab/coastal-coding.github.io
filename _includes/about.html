      <h1>10-12 January 2019<br/>ReproNim/Nipype Workshop</h1>
      <p>
        The goals of this workshop are two-fold. First, to enable attendees to become familiar with best
        practices for reproducible analysis from
        <a href=http://www.reproducibleimaging.org>ReproNim</a>.
        Second, to learn how to create scalable and re-executable neuroimaging workflows with the upcoming
        <a href=https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest>Nipype 2.0</a> platform.
        Advanced users are welcome to learn about the changes and hack with Nipype developers.
      </p>
      <p>Requiruements:
       <li>Working knowledge of Python 3</li>
       <li>Familiarity with scripting in at least 1 neuroimaging package (e.g., AFNI, ANTS, FSL, FreeSurfer, SPM)</li>
      </p>
      <h1>14-16 January 2019<br/>NiMARE Code Sprint</h1>
      <h3>ABOUT NIMARE</h3>
      <p>
        NiMARE (Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment) is a new Python package for
        performing analyses using neuroimaging meta-analytic data. Current tools for neuroimaging
        meta-analyses are spread out across several packages and languages. NiMARE aims to provide a
        standardized interface for a broad range of algorithms, along with interfaces to open
        meta-analytic resources like <a href=http://neurosynth.org>Neurosynth</a>,
        <a href=https://neurovault.org>NeuroVault</a>, and
        <a href=https://brainspell.herokuapp.com>brainspell</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>ABOUT THE SPRINT</h3>
      <p>
        The three-day NiMARE coding sprint will occur after the Nipype workshop, with a one-day rest
        period between, in which participants can enjoy Miami. At the sprint, weâ€™ll be working to design
        a standard for representing meta-analytic data, to add implementations for new tools, and to
        improve the documentation and test coverage of the existing codebase. Anyone interested in
        contributing to this new package is welcome to join. Experience with Python or neuroimaging
        meta-analysis recommended, but not necessary.
