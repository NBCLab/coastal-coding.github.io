                <h2>About NiMARE</h2>
                <p>NiMARE (Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment) is a new Python package for performing analyses using neuroimaging meta-analytic data. Current tools for neuroimaging meta-analyses are spread out across several packages and languages. NiMARE aims to provide a standardized interface for a broad range of algorithms, along with interfaces to open meta-analytic resources like Neurosynth, NeuroVault, and brainspell.</p>

                <h2>About the sprint</h2>
                <p>The NiMARE coding sprint will be a three-day hackathon in Miami, Florida, at Florida International University's scenic Biscayne Bay campus. The sprint will occur after a three-day Nipype workshop, with a two-day rest period between, in which participants can enjoy Miami.</p>
                <p>At the sprint, weâ€™ll be working to design a standard for representing meta-analytic data, to add implementations for new tools, and to improve the documentation and test coverage of the existing codebase. Anyone interested in contributing to this new package is welcome to join. Experience with Python or neuroimaging meta-analysis recommended, but not necessary. On the first day of the sprint there will be an overview of neuroimaging meta-analytic methods for beginners.
